# E-commerce Application based on Spring Boot back-end and Angular front-end

## Description:
API is build using spring boot as the core framework and uses OKTA OIDC for handling security, spring data REST and JPA for ORM mappings and auto REST endpoint creation and MySql as SQL database.
Project is still under development and I keep on adding new features, fixing bugs. 
This Project was started to learn Angular and How to integrate Angular applications to Spring based applications.
